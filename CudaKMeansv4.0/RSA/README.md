RSA-Encryption-with-CUDA
========================

This project has been assigned to me as part of my course on Parallel Programming at Seneca College.
In this project, students are to find or create an application, assess its candidacy for parallelization, and then
use NVidia's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) API to parallelize a portion of the application.

I chose to parallelize Nedim Srndic's implementation of the RSA algorithm, which can be be found at http://code.google.com/p/rsa/
